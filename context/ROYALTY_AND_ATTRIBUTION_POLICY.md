# Royalty & Attribution Policy (Hackathon Build)

This repository is a hackathon submission artifact.

## Attribution
- Third-party references (docs/repos) are listed in `manifest.json` under `attribution.sources`.
- Source URLs are provided for educational and verification purposes.

## Royalty plan
- **Baseline open-source core:** no royalties.
- Any future “Pro/private” extensions are **not included in this repo** and are out of scope for this hackathon.

## Safety note
- This document is intentionally short to avoid legal over-claims.
- If an upstream license requires additional notices, we will update `manifest.json` and this file accordingly.
