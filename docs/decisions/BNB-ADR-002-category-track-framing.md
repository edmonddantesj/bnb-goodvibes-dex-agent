# BNB-ADR-002 — Category/Track Framing

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-02-17 (KST)
- **Scope:** Hackathon submission metadata + positioning
- **Participants (role-based):** Governance, Ops, Builder

## Context
The submission needed a category/track selection and a clear framing that matches the project’s core value.

## Options Considered
1) Frame as a "DeFi bot" / trading tool
2) Frame as a "safe onchain agent" / AI agent workflow

## Decision
Frame as **Option 2**: a **safe onchain agent** (AI agent) with proof-first artifacts.

## Reasons (judge-friendly)
- **Differentiation:** safety + verifiable artifacts are clearer than generic bot framing.
- **Evaluation fit:** judges can verify behavior via links/artifacts without trusting claims.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: category mismatch confusion
  - Mitigation: keep language consistent across README, demo, and submission answers.
